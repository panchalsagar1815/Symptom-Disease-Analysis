# Symptom-Disease-Analysis



The "Disease Symptom Analysis" project is a comprehensive investigation into medical data aimed at understanding and analyzing disease symptoms. Leveraging an extensive dataset with features such as _id, chief_complaint_id, chief_complaint_name_id, name, reason_code, life_threatening, msp_enabled, primary_complaint, and diagnosis_count, the project focuses on extracting meaningful insights through various analytical methodologies.

The project was initiated with an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) process to ensure the data's integrity, cleanliness, and uniformity. Subsequently, the data underwent scaling to facilitate consistent and accurate analysis. The application of statistical methods, combined with data visualization using the Seaborn library and Matplotlib, allowed for a comprehensive exploration of patterns and relationships within the dataset.

As part of the analytical framework, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model was employed to delve deeper into the complex relationships among the variables. This advanced machine learning model enhances the project's predictive capabilities and contributes to the identification of significant factors influencing disease symptoms.

The insights derived from this analysis not only provide a better understanding of the relationships between symptoms and diagnoses but also contribute to improved medical decision-making and patient care. By employing a combination of statistical methods, data visualization, and advanced machine learning, the "Disease Symptom Analysis" project aims to advance our understanding of medical data and pave the way for enhanced diagnostic and treatment strategies.
